          <h1>Does Comedians have democracy in india ?</h1>
          <small>October, 2022</small>
          <p>
            One of India's top stand-up comedians, Vir Das, recently delivered a monologue called "Two Indias" while performing in Washington DC, in which he shared his thoughts about the South Asian nation's social issues.   

During the show, Das described India as a country of paradoxes where people "worship women during the day but gang rape them at night."

The show drew sharp criticism and even resulted in legal cases against the comic. Critics have accused him of defaming India.</p>

            Increasing loneliness and depression. While it may seem that losing yourself online will temporarily make feelings such as loneliness, depression, and boredom evaporate into thin air, it can actually make you feel even worse. A 2014 study found a correlation between high social media usage and depression and anxiety. Users, especially teens, tend to compare themselves unfavorably with their peers on social media, promoting feelings of loneliness and depression.

Fueling anxiety. One researcher found that the mere presence of a phone in a work place tends to make people more anxious and perform poorly on given tasks. The heavier a people phone use, the greater the anxiety they experienced.
